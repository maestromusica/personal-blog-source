# Not finishing means no value

Just a prompt :)

# another thing

Another idea the article mentions is always focusing at one goal at a time. This can be applied in order to improve the way you work: focus on one task, one tab at a time, don't context switch the moment you started feeling tired or bored.


# Assumptions should be explicit

- alignment on what the ideal architecture should look like is very important
- you want everyone to be on the same page and you want everyone to be aware of the goals you are trying to accomplish

# My personal coding guiding principles
1. Leave the code simpler than you found it
1. Assumptions should be explicit
1. Always be open to feedback


# Self-improvement is worth it

- I'm so grateful to the past me for all the hard work I've done in the past.
- I would not be in the same place I'm now if it hadn't been for all work that I've put in.
I could have chosen to get good at gaming, I could have chosen to watch TV shows in all of my free time. But I did not do that. As a student I got into self-help books
- I challenged myself to read 50 non-fiction books in a year, I wish I chose a different number and I had been more deliberate about the choise of those 50 books, but regardless, I got a lot of benefit from that exercise. I've read book like Man's search for meaning

# The correct way to get into the hobby

- This is very subjective but I fell like I have quite strong feelings about what is the "correct" way to get into a hobby
- Buy the minimal amount of equipment possible, or rent
- Use what you already have, if possible and sensible
- Spend the minimum amout of time possible fighting with the setup, stop preparing and start doing
- If you're anything like me, you probably are quite likely to get bored with the hobby, find it is too difficult, doesn't play into your strengths, is not compatible with your life-style or goals, is not as enjoyable to do as it seemed, or the experience is just different than what you imagined and it is not something you are interested in continuing to do
- My mom got into jigsaw puzzles and quickly amased a sizable collection - she only managed to get thought a part of it before, understandably, getting a bit bored with the hobby. It was her choice to go about this hobby this way and she enjoyed treating herself to the puzzles, I prefer to get cracking and either get really immersed in the hobby (and treat myself with whatever stuff I need to do said hobby) or just get the bare minimum
- For example I got into mechanical keyboard and I was watching dozen of YT videos tryging to figure out which boards (yes, plural) to buy to cover "all the bases", then I realised that there is a good chance I will get bored quickly and instead went for a Keychrone K2 Pro. I LOVED (and still love!) this keyboard but predictably, my interest in mechanical keyboards wilttered. Thanks to maintaining _some_ amount of self-control with my purchasing and employing the Start Doing startegy I saved myself quite a bit of money, and equly importatnyl, storage space in my flat.


# Jekyll is amazing

Today during my weekly retrospective session, I decided that I want to revive this blog.
I resisted the urge to shave the yak before getting to the actual, difficult work - writing itself, and it took me about 15 minutes to get set up on my laptop, practically from scratch. I'm still affected by not documenting any of the technical decisions that I made when I first started the blog. My setup is a bit unusual - I have a separate, private repository with the source code, and a separate Github pages repository which I use to host it. For the love of me I cannot remember why I decided to go with this setup! Or if I have customized my Jekyll setup in any way (which would warrant, generating the HTML setup correctly )

I logically know that writing is good, I can list so many benefits and yet
Writing is a lot of fun as a hobby
I’ve been doing writing in private - writing a fairly structured journal to review the week
5-minute journal never stuck with me for whatever reason
But I think it could be beneficial long term and I will keep trying to find a way of
I need to find a variant of that habit that will give me the most benefit
The main benefits
Writing helps me clarify how what I actually believe about a certain topic
I need to “talk through the problem” in order to be able to write which helps me clarify my position and my blind spots/missing bits of knowledge
Writing made it easier for me to express my thoughts
Personal brand benefit not very relevant at the moment as I would need many, many more visitors to actually reap any benefits from the blog
But I do enjoy reading other people’s blogs so that is very cool



Roadblocks
I’m not sure how to get feedback
Is there a service? Can I pay someone to get feedback?
Finding time is tough
Let’s be honest, if it’s important then I will find time one way or another, it’s not a real problem
Blog maintenance - google analytics does not work at the moment, I choose not to care about that right now
Jekyll is kinda awesome, I'm so
