# About

I'm a software engineer based in London and I dabble with all kinds of programming languages and in all kinds of projects but I'm mostly focusing on Python and front-end technologies. 

If you want to learn more about me take a look at my [resume](\assets\resume_lukasz_domanski.pdf) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldomanski/).
